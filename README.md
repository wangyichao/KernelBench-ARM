# KernelBench-ARM
Key Scientific Computing Kernels for HPC Workloads on ARM

Update Date: 4 Aug 2019

These kernel benchmarks were all developed by the team at Center for HPC in Shanghai Jiao Tong Unviersity.

We are collecting key scientific computing kernels for HPC workloads, and then implement parallel version with OpenMP and optimizations in order to explore potential of high performance computing on ARM-based SoC.
